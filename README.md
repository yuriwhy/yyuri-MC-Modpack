# ADVENTURA: Minecraft Comes Alive Edition

### *A Minecraft modpack originally focused on adventure, but now with a whole new experience! The [Minecraft Comes Alive Reborn](https://modrinth.com/mod/minecraft-comes-alive-reborn) mod!*

**Requirements:**
- Minecraft 1.21.1
- Fabric 0.18.1 or later

### Regarding the launcher and which file to download:
*I recommend Prism Launcher for this modpack, but the modpack should work fine with the Curseforge and Modrinth launchers.*

*When downloading the modpack, if you're not using the Curseforge or Modrinth launcher, I recommend downloading the file "prismlauncher-x.x.x-x.zip" as it's the entire modpack, but compressed, even if it's just a version for Prism Launcher.*

## Editions of ADVENTURA!
